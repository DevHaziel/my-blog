    excerpt:
      "Why accessibility is crucial for web development and how I'm implementing it in my WorldSkills preparation.",
    content: [
      "Accessibility is a fundamental aspect of web development that ensures everyone, regardless of their abilities or disabilities, can use and navigate websites effectively. As I prepare for WorldSkills, I've been deepening my understanding of accessibility best practices.",
      "Semantic HTML forms the foundation of accessible websites. Using the right elements for their intended purpose (like buttons for actions and links for navigation) provides built-in accessibility features that assistive technologies can leverage.",
      "ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes can enhance accessibility when HTML alone isn't sufficient. However, it's important to remember the first rule of ARIA: don't use ARIA if native HTML can achieve the same result.",
      "Keyboard navigation is essential for users who can't use a mouse. I've been ensuring that all interactive elements are focusable, visible focus indicators are maintained, and logical tab order is preserved. Testing my applications without a mouse has been eye-opening.",
      "Color contrast is crucial for users with visual impairments. I use tools like the WebAIM Contrast Checker to ensure text meets WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards. It's also important to never rely on color alone to convey information.",
      "Alternative text for images provides context for screen reader users. I've been practicing writing concise, descriptive alt text that conveys the purpose of images rather than just describing them literally.",
      "Form accessibility includes proper labeling, error handling, and instructions. Each input should have an associated label, error messages should be linked to their respective fields, and instructions should be provided before they're needed.",
      "Testing with assistive technologies has been invaluable. I've been using screen readers like NVDA and VoiceOver to experience my applications as blind users would, and making adjustments based on that experience.",
      "In the WorldSkills competition, accessibility will be a key evaluation criterion. By incorporating these practices into my development workflow now, I'm not only preparing for the competition but also becoming a better developer who creates websites that truly work for everyone.",

    content: [
      "Responsive web design is no longer optional—it's expected. As I prepare for the WorldSkills competition, I've been refining my approach to building layouts that work beautifully across all device sizes.",
      "CSS Grid has revolutionized how we create two-dimensional layouts. I've been using it for overall page structure, creating complex grid systems that adapt to different screen sizes without relying on media queries.",
      "Flexbox complements Grid perfectly for one-dimensional layouts. I use it for components like navigation menus, card layouts, and centering elements both horizontally and vertically.",
      "The 'mobile-first' approach has been my guiding principle. I start by designing for small screens and then progressively enhance the layout for larger screens. This ensures that the core experience works well on any device.",
      "Modern CSS units like vh, vw, rem, and ch have been game-changers for responsive design. They allow for more fluid layouts that adapt to both screen size and user preferences like font size.",
      "Container queries are the next evolution in responsive design. Unlike media queries that look at the viewport size, container queries allow components to adapt based on their parent container's size. I've been experimenting with the @container query for more modular responsive components.",
      "CSS custom properties (variables) have made it easier to create consistent, adaptable designs. I use them for everything from spacing scales to breakpoint values, making it simple to maintain and update styles across an entire application.",
      "Performance considerations are crucial for responsive design. Techniques like using srcset for responsive images, avoiding large frameworks when possible, and being mindful of CSS specificity all contribute to faster-loading responsive sites.",
      "In the WorldSkills competition, we'll need to create layouts that not only look good on different devices but also consider usability across contexts. These modern CSS techniques will help me create flexible, robust layouts efficiently.",
